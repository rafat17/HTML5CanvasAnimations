# HTML5CanvasAnimations
HTML 5 Canvas Animation done using Javascript

This repository contains all my work in HTML canvas animation using javascript

**Brief note on JS files :
JS files comprise of each type of animation that can be manipulated to run on the HTML5 canvas

**JS files in this repository :

(1) particleanimation.js --> Small circular particle that move around the canvas that tends to change in size and get bigger or smaller when mouse pointer is hovered over them

(2) rect.js --> Small rectangular or square that are being made to move around the HTML5 canvas

(3) gravity.js --> Circular particles are made to fall,hit and bounce off the base of the canvas due to gravity 



The files in this repository include :

(1) index.html
(2) styles.css
(3) any js file of your choice from this repository (such as particleanimation.js)

the file number (3) above comprises of the javascript code representing the animating movement of circular particles
in the HTML5 canvas

the file number (2) comprises of the css file for styling the canvas size and the body of the displaying page

the file number (1) comprises of the main html file where we referenced the main js file (particlesanimation.js) to run the animation
on the HTML5 canvas

To display this animation download the three files.
Store them in the same directory and run the index.html file on any browser that supports the canvas tag of HTML5.
